# ajio_backend_clone
This is an e-commerce Website and we made this clone in just 5 Days. This project is an extension of our last project we added some backend features also. The flow of the website is Homepage -> product page -> Specific Product page -> Cart page -> Payment page -> Address Page -> Order Confirmation page. We also added Google Auth and sorting for price color and size also.
